  ## Description

  As a group we have created an application designed to help parents track the everyday events for a new child by giving them a simple application to add a child to the dashboard and then add individual events for that child as they occur.

  ## Usage

  Login with your username or email and password. Or if you are a new user create a new account.  
  From there you will be directed to your user page and given options to:
  - add a child to your account.
  - select a child that you already had saved. 
  - create an event for a child saved to your account.
